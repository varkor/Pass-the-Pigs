One particularly thrilling day, after a hard and energetic game of Pass the Pigs with the fellow enthusiasts, I realised just how little the game depended on physical pieces. And, remembering the age-old adage: "There is little as enjoyable as a text-based game.", I decided to combine two of the world's greatest pleasures into one united whole.

This Pass the Pigs simulator is completely true to the rules, with all the positions and combos you've come to expect from that most wonderful of games. It supports local multiplayer, plus as many bots as you think it takes to challenge your finely-honed skills. Be warned: once you start playing, it could be a while before you stop.
